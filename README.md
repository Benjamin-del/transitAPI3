# BENJA TRANSIT API3

![Last GTFS Update](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FBenjamin-del%2FTransitDB3%2Fmain%2Fupdate.json&query=update&label=Last%20GTFS%20Update&color=red) 

This API uses GTFS and the wonky OC Transpo API to supply the backend for Benja Transit.

This app supports the OC TRANSPO API (Found at: https://www.octranspo.com/en/plan-your-trip/travel-tools/developers)

Tools Used
- OC Transpo API
- TurfJS (turf/helper)
- Luxon

## API
The following methods are available for use:
 - `GET /oct/allstops` - Returns all stops in the OC Transpo GTFS File (@ FTP SERVER)
 - `GET /oct/realtime` - Data from OC Transpo's Realtime API, Provided in JSON format
 - `GET oct/shape` - Using data from the GTFS File, this returns the shape of the route (WITHOUT TRIP ID, See below for full documentation)
 - `GET oct/schedule` - A Static Schedule for a specific Stop ID
 - `GET oct/config` - Theme Information for the OC Transpo API
 - `GET oct/shapebyid` - Get the shape of the route using the shape ID

### OCT/SHAPE

The OC Transpo API dosen't provide information about what trip... This makes it hard to figure out what shape it is currently running. Since routes have different brances (Stitsville / Tunneys Pasture) The shape is different. Using the following paramaters the server is able to figure out what shape it is running. There may be multiple that match the query so it returns as an array.

| Paramater     | Description              | Example           |
| ------------- | -------------------------| ----------------- |
| `route`       | The Route Number         | `61`              | 
| `direction`   | The Direction            | `0`               | 
| `startTime`   | The Start Time (HH:MM)   | `15:03`           |
| All above values are required                                |


## Static GTFS
For OC Transpo, I have deflated some GTFS files, they are available at a seperate Repo (Available at: https://benjamin-del.github.io/TransitDB3). You can use this repo with your worker but I would suggest forking that repo and using your own version.


## Installation
This is designed to run on a Cloudflare Worker. It could be ported over to a express server or other serverless components but that is not supported.

1. Fork the project and create a `.dev.vars` file in the root directory. I would sugest using wrangler. It should look like this:


    ```
    # OCTRANSPO API
    OCTRANSPO_API_KEY="0000111122223333444"
    OCTRANSPO_APP_ID="1234566"
    ```
    (Fill in the values)
    
2. Install Coudlflare Wrangler. You can find the instructions here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update

3. Configure your server where you get the GTFS files from. The configuration is found at `src/helper/gtfs-static.js`, line `6`. The current server will not work.

4. run `npm run start` to test the server locally. The server will usually run at `http://localhost:8787`.

5. run `npm run deploy` to deploy the server to cloudflare. The server is ready at  `https://yourpoject.yourname.workers.dev`.
